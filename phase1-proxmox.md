<h1>PROXMOX</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I set up PROXMOX on my laptop.

Equipment I used for this set up:
- laptop (with charging cable)
- e-thernet to USB-C adapter cable
  - connects to router
- USB drive with Ventoy installed
  - You can install Ventoy on their webpage. [X](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)

<h2>Add static DHCP</h2>
Doing this reserves your local IP address so that the server's IP address does not change.
- Go to PROXMOX SHELL > type "ip a" into SHELL > pull from nic0: link/ ether
